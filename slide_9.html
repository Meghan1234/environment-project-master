        <h1>Solutions to Pollution</h1>
        <h3>Even though pollution is a huge issue there is still a lot you can do to help out.</h3>
        <u>Conserve energy</u>
        <p>Producing energy requires a lot of fossil fuel burning. You can help this by minimizing your use of your lights and ceiling fans in your house.</p> 
        <u>Start using clean energy</u>
        <P>These include solar, geothermal, electromagnetic, and wind. These produce energy without having to burn fossil fuels.</p>
        <u>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</u>
	    <p>Make what you have into something new. Throw away the least amount possible.</p>
        <u>Reduce your emissions through your transportation</u>
	    <p>Cars give off a lot of emissions. You can carpool more, use public transportation, use                        
        hybrid or electric cars, walk, or ride your bike.</p>
        <h3>There is a lot being done by people around the world to help out with this issue</h3>
        <p>- For about 30 years the United States environmental protection agency has been limiting emissions from many different industrial plants and are expecting to reduce emissions by 1.7 millions tons annually.</p>
        <p>- Paris has banned traffic in some popular tourist areas on weekends to encourage people to walk and ride their bikes, and has made public transportation free for special events so fewer people bring their cars.</p>
        <p>- In the Netherland politicians are looking to ban selling gasoline run vehicles in 2025.</p>
