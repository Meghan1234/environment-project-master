        <h1>Pollution</h1>
        <p> Pollutants in the air aren't always visible, and they come from different sources. Poor air quality kills people. Worldwide, bad air caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, about 90 percent of them in low and middle-income countries, according to the World Health Organization. Indoor smoke is an ongoing health threat to the 3 billion people who cook and heat their homes by burning biomass, kerosene, and coal. Air pollution has been linked to higher rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases such as asthma. In the U.S. nearly 134 million people—over 40 percent of the population—are at risk of disease and premature death because of air pollution, according to American Lung Association estimates.</p>
