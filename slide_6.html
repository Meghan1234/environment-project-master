        <h1>Climate Change Solutions</h1>
        <p>- Powering your home with solar or wind is still one of the best ways to fight climate change. </p>
        <p>- You can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions by eating less meat, choosing local foods when possible and buying food with less packaging. </p> 
        <p>- Choose a fuel efficient vehicle when purchasing, take public transportation if itâ€™s available, carpool to work, ride a bicycle or walk when possible.</p>
         <p>- Compost food scraps. According to the EPA, about 18 percent of methane pollution comes from food scraps that ended up in landfills. But if those leftovers, peels, cores and cuttings were composted, they would reduce emissions and help protect healthy soil.</p>
         <p>- Plant trees, to help suck carbon out of the air and stabilize the climate.</p>
