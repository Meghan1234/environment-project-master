        <h1>Endangered Ecosystems & Species</h1>
        <p class="species"> An endangered species is an organism that is threatened by extinction. 
An endangered ecosystem is an environment that is at the risk of being lost.
These are caused by loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation. 
“The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.”
“If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** -  then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year.”
(WWF).
