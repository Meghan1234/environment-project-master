        <h1>Deforestation</h1>
        <p> Deforestation is the mass destruction of trees.
 Trees are vital for our lives. They absorb carbon dioxide and convert it into our oxygen.
Trees also help regulate the green-house gases that humans create.
“Forests still cover about 30 percent of the world’s land area, but they are disappearing at an alarming rate.
 Between 1990 and 2016, the world lost 
502,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) of forest,
according to the World Bank—an area larger than South Africa.”
“Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, 
and drilling combined account for more than half of all deforestation.”(National Geographic)
